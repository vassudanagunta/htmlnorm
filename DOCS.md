# üìú principles

## designed for testing

`htmlnorm`'s raison d'√™tre is testing. This means:

- **It will be maximally conservative if there is any ambiguity.** 

  Specifically, if there is any ambiguity as to the semantics of the input that is not disambiguated by the HTML5 spec ([this one?](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html)), then `htmlnorm` will return the input as-is, untouched. This ensures that `htmlnorm` doesn't inadvertently allow tests to pass that shouldn't pass because it chose the wrong interpretation. 

- "beautification" is not a primary concern, and is done only in service of testing.

  That said, you may really like the pretty printing `htmlnorm` performs.

- There is no guaranteed stability of how `htmlnorm` formats from version to version, though it will only change when justified -- to further improve its purpose.

  - stability is not required for testing, because `htmlnorm` is intended to be applied to both the test output and the expected value -- in other words they will both be normalized by the current version of `htmlnorm` and comparable. The output of `htmlnorm` is not intended to be preserved as test artifacts or fixtures.



## Pretty printing vs normalization

> ## ‚ö†Ô∏è this is redundant with the section in the README. Pick one spot, and link to it from the other.



As [someone pointed out](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/issues/1732#issuecomment-560138462) about JS-Beautifier:

> Your formatter is meant to take existing HTML source code and make it prettier by *improving* it, while still maintaining certain aesthetic decisions of the author (e.g. whether the author places extra newlines between paragraphs, etc.).

In other words, it doesn't normalize, just beautifies some things, and leaves alone other author choices, meaning two HTML docs that are actually semantically identical will not always be reformatted or reduced to a normalized or canonical form. 

---

document another difference between pretty printing and testing-oriented normalization:

whenever there are two semantically equivalent ways of expressing the same thing, then they both should be normalized to the exact same form (whether it is one of the two or a third form).

For example, the first form below looks great, and a pretty printer might leave it alone. But a pretty printer might also leave the second one alone, thinking: *given the context(inside single quotes), the internal quotes must remain escaped.*  But for `htmlnorm`  that is result in failed tests. So it MUST choose one of the two and ALWAYS transform to that form. It would have to choose between (a) ALWAYS choosing double quotes for the outer quotes and escaping as necessary or (b) employ complex logic, changing the outer quotes to single when the value contains double (and only double).

# ‚úÖ Line and whitespace reformatting


## üü® notes moved here from the code

Three basic decisions/operations on whitespace:
1. When to COLLAPSE to single space
2. When to REMOVE as run entirely.
3. When to INSERT to produce hierarchical structure.

### When to COLLAPSE
- outside of PRE, we collapse all whitespace runs to a single space.

### When to REMOVE
- STANDARD: we remove leading and trailing whitespace of any BLOCK's contents
- CONSERVATIVE: ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì

### When to INSERT
- STANDARD:
  - between any sibling BLOCKS (including anonymous inline text blocks)
  - between a CONTAINER BLOCK open/close tags and it's contents
- CONSERVATIVE:
  - same as STANDARD, but only if there is/was whitespace in that spot
    in the source originally. In other words, it's more a REPLACE than
    an INSERT. If there was no whitespace, we can't INSERT any without
    potentially altering how it is rendered --- and normalizing HTML
    CANNOT impact the visual rendering.

### THE NET AFFECT IS:
1. We don't insert whitespace where it does not exist in the source.
   This includes adding newlines or indentation to format the HTML source
   as a nice hierarchical structure. We will only do so when we can (i.e.
   whitespace already exists)
2. we don't remove whitespace where it does exist in the source. But we
   will:
   - reduces runs of whitespace between inline elements to a single space
   - replace the whitespace with a different run of whitespace in order to
     reformat the HTML source as a nice hierarchical structure, with blocks
     on their own lines.

### Analogy
So just as one wouldn't insert a space or newline in the middle of the
word "solidarity" when laying out a sentence, one doesn't insert a space
or newline between the `<q>` and the inner text of `"<q>a quote</q>`
because the <q> ends up rendering a a quotation mark and you'd end up with
`" a quote "`, which is obviously wrong and not what the author intended.

### THINGS WE DON'T ASSUME IN CONSERVATIVE MODE
1. That a normally block element won't be recast as inline by CSS
2. That a normally block element won't be recast as inline by CSS ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
3. That tags that wrap an inline element don't also correspond to glyph(s),   <--- actually we do this for STANDARD mode too
   a border or other visible manifestation where the a space between the
   tag and its inner content can be ignored.  [??? also between it and outer adjacencies?]
4. Since a block can be recasts as inline, #3 applies to blocks.



## `htmlnorm`  formats all unknown tags as inline. 

- this corresponds with browser/CSS defaults
- this is also the most conservative, as `htmlnorm`'s rules for inlines are more conservative than for blocks (though they are identical in CONSERVATIVE mode)




## ‚úÖ `STANDARD` mode

`STANDARD` mode **assumes HTML blocks elements have CSS `block` flow.** [`STANDARD` mode **assumes that each HTML defined element will have the same flow semantics as defined by the XXX default CSS.**] That inline elements will remain inline and block will remain block. This means we can insert whitespace between block-level elements even if there is no whitespace in the source.

1. Insert whitespace (newlines and spaces) between HTML blocks elements with newlines and spaces to form a visual hierarchy. Do so even if the source HTML has no whitespace between the tags, e.g. 

   ```
   <li><p>1</p><p>2</p></li>
   ```

   will be rendered as:

   ```
   <li>
     <p>1</p>
     <p>2</p>
   <li>
   ```
   > ## üüß need to distinguish between leaf and container blocks in the above description? Perhaps use a table to compare the four: inline, leaf block, container block, pre block?

2. Collapse all other contiguous whitespace runs to a single space. "Whitespace" here means spaces, tabs and newlines.

3. üüß Remove leading and trailing whitespace within each leaf block element

As a *semi-conservative* precaution, we do treat whitespace runs spanning an inline tag as a single run, even when the default CSS rule for that tag produces no visual element that separates the whitespace on either side. This rule is consistent with how browsers parse the HTML into the DOM[^1]. It has no impact on the ability to reformat blocks onto separate lines with indentation to create a visual hierarchy in the source.

---

[^1]: üüß  See Open Question about whether browsers collapse whitespace before CSS sees anything





## ‚úÖ `CONSERVATIVE` mode

`CONSERVATIVE` mode assumes that CSS rules might alter the flow property of any normally block element to `inline`. This means the existence of whitespace or the lack thereof is significant even between sibling element tags, and so cannot be arbitrarily altered. Specifically: 

1. Never add some where there was none.
2. Never reduce to none where there was some.

In other words, HTML whitespace semantics are such that all whitespace reduces down to a binary either-or: 

- **EITHER** there is whitespace between to things, with the amount not mattering:
  
  ``` html
  <p>1</p> <p>2</p>
  
  <p>1</p>
  <p>2</p>
  
  <p>1</p>     <p>2</p>
  ```

- **OR** there is not:

  ``` html
  <p>1</p><p>2</p>
  ```

`CONSERVATIVE` mode is careful not to change the sources condition form one to the other.

which means:

- ‚úÖ **never collapse white space to `zero space`.** Any run of consecutive whitespace characters (space, tabs, newlines) can be collapse, replaced by, or expanded into to any another other consecutive run of whitespace characters and the document remains semantically identical.
- ‚úÖ **never introduce space between to elements separated by `zero space` in the source.** This means, for example, when the opening tag of a paragraph abuts the closing tag a preceding paragraph, with no space between them), they are on the same line and must remain so. (One is free to break the text for these to paragraphs across lines anywhere there exists a space in the content of either paragraph.)

The only exception is around **PRE** and **BR** tags. These two tags are **void** tags with such explicit whitespace semantics that it makes no sense for a CSS rule to alter their meaning.

Otherwise the same as `standard` mode. 

The impact of `CONSERVATIVE` mode is that blocks whose tags have no whitespace between them cannot be broken onto separate lines or indented, limiting the ability to reformat those blocks into a visual hierarchy. Such "run-on" block elements will remain on a single line, potentially a very long one.

`custom` mode is builds off of `standard`, but allows you to change the `inline` vs `leaf block` vs `container block`  property for any element.





# üüß Tag Normalization



## üüß WIP: `closing_tags` mode

>
> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#optional-tags
>
> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#syntax-tag-omission



Four possible options:

- `AS-IS` (default)

  - no closing tags will be added or removed
  - BUT the formatting of the document will reflect implicit closure, whether per HTML rules or mimicking browser handling of tag soup

- `EXPLICIT`

  - all unclosed tags are normalized via insertion of explicit close tags:

    - first, per HTML5 rules, some tags are implicitly closed open the opening of others (e.g. successive `p` tags without intervening close tags, as `p` cannot contain a `p`)

    - mimic browser handling of tag-soup. e.g. an unclosed blockquote will be automatically closed if its parent container terminates (including termination of the root doc container)

      I think htmlparser2 does this so it should be easy to implement.

- `HTML5 IMPLICIT`

  - removes close tags for elements in contexts that support implicit closure, per HTML5 specs

  > üö© SAME "DO NOT use" caveat as `EXPLICIT_CLOSE` mode.

  > üèà I think this one is not so important, and since it isn't trivial to implement, punt for now

- `STRICT MODE` / `SAFE MODE`

  - if a document is missing any close tags, `htmlnorm` will simply return the input unchanged. This is useful for test contexts where the user does not want tests to pass if any tag soup fixes were employed and/or wants to test cases where tag soup is expected.

If you read the accepted answer to the question, it is clear that for block level elements in sequence (be it originally a block or an inline coerced into a block by containing a block), `zero-space` and `space`  have the same effect: the blocks are distinct and separate, and thus rendered.
