# `htmlnorm` test cases

Each code block below represents a test case for the `htmlnorm` function. Above
the dashed line is the `input`, and below it is the `expected output`. The text
just above the block describes the rule or the expectation.

Any `tab` characters in `input` or  `expected output` values are represented
with `â†’`. They will be converted to real tabs before being used to test
`htmlnorm`.


> ðŸŒ¶ The order of these tests and the order of any failures matter
> 
> The tests are arranged such that if a test is targeting
> functionality D, but must use functionality A, B and C 
> to test D, then the tests for A, B and C will come first.
> 
> This means that if a test fails and it is the only failure,
> it is likely that the functionality it targets is broken.
> But if one or more earlier tests fail, its failure could
> simply be those early failures cascading down. In other
> words, in general, it is usually more fruitful to look
> at early failures first.




## preliminary sanity checks

These are simple, already normalized inputs that should
be returned unchanged. Many of the more in-depth tests
assume this basic behavior, so we verify these up front.

The cases in this section SHOULD BE INVARIANT regardless
of `htmlnorm` custom settings (i.e. the same `OUT` for
all `IN`s).

### [CASE] leave unchanged already normalized simple text

### errors

#### [CASE] duplicate attributes

Duplicates attributes are a parse error according to the spec.
But the spec also says browsers can gracefully handle the error,
and if they choose to do so, MUST ignore all but the first
(lexical first, not alphabetical first). Currently `htmlnorm` operates
in line with the latter approach.
See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/43859478/8910547.

> ### ðŸš© This may be the wrong approach
It can potentially hide behavior that should result in test failure.
Since `htmlnorm`'s primary purpose is for testing, this would obviously be
bad. See open questions in the docs.

#### `<q>` vs `<i>`

The cases in this section compares normalization behavior for two
inline elements that typically render differently, where the
difference sometimes demands different treatment of whitespace.

The `<q>` and `</q>` tags typically manifest as open and close
quotation marks, respectively, implemented via CSS `::before`
and `::after` pseudo-elements rules. This makes whitespace
before, after, or on both sides of the tags always significant.

In contrast, the `<i>` and `</i>` tags typically have no physical
manifestation *themselves*, only affecting the font-styling of
the content they wrap. That there is or isn't whitespace between
the *rendered* italicized text and its surrounding text is
significant, but whether that whitespace itself is italicized,
not so much. If there is whitespace on both sides, only that on 
one is deemed necessary; there should only be on space between
the *rendered* italicized text and its surrounding text. The rule
browsers use is to collapse the whitespace to one side. The side
chosen is the "first" side, as determined by the direction of
the text, left-to-right or right-to-left.

You can see this yourself, by looking at your browser's DOM
representation of 
[the HTML rendered form of this test suite](add link here), 
or that of in this demonstration
[study of how browsers collapse whitespace](../browser-whitespace-study.html).

[//]: # (todo replace links above with the correct URLs when
          this is published.)

`htmlnorm`, even in its default non-conservative mode, will
not assume the default CSS rendering rules for `<i>`, `<q>`
or any other inline element. If whitespace occurs on both sides
of a tag, both will be preserved.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<h3>Wild thing. You make my heart sing.</h3>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] inner inline sequence with newlines
[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing.
<b>You</b> make
my <i><b>heart</b> sing</i>.</p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing. <b>You</b> make my <i><b>heart</b> sing</i>.</p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] `<br>` inside a leaf block

Content of a leaf block after the `<br>` will be indented.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing.<br>You make my heart sing.</p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing.<br>
    You make my heart sing.</p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] `<br>` at end of leaf block

Content of a leaf block after the `<br>` will be indented.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing.<br>You make my heart sing.<br></p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing.<br>
    You make my heart sing.<br>
    </p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] `<br>` immediately preceding inline close tag

While there is no real world reason to put the closing inline
tag below after the `<br>`rather than before it, it is technically
valid HTML. `htmlnorm` has supposed to have coherently consistent
behavior, so we test this, even if a bit anal ðŸ¤£

In fact this test only exists because while examining the code I
noticed a gap in the logic, and this test was written to prove it
before I attempted to fix the logic. The logic flaw only occurred
when `<br>` was followed by an inline close tag without any intervening
text and only in CONSERVATIVE mode.

Yes, 

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p><strong>Wild thing.<br></strong> You make my heart
sing.</p>

``````````````````````````````````````````````````


### leaf block sequences (siblings)

``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] all run-on siblings

This is identical to the last case, except that the
closing tag of each leaf block is run-on with the
opening tag of the next leaf.

[OUT: CONSERVATIVE] lack of space between container tags and content preserved
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<blockquote><i>Wild</i> thing.</blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] `<br>` within normal container

Content after the `<br>` will be indented.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<blockquote>Wild thing.<br>You make my heart sing.</blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]

``````````````````````````````````````````````````


#### [CASE] `<br>` at end of normal container

Content after the `<br>` will be indented.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<blockquote>Wild thing.<br>You make my heart sing.<br></blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<li><i>Wild</i><br> thing.</li>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT] `<br>` cancels leaf formatting
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT: CONSERVATIVE] `<br>` cancels leaf formatting
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<li><i>Wild</i><br>
  thing.</li>

### child leaf blocks

#### [CASE] single leaf block
[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<li><p>You make my heart sing.</p></li>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT] single child still goes on own line
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<li>
  <p>You make my heart sing.</p>
</li>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT: CONSERVATIVE] a lack of space between parent and child tags forces them on same line
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<li><p>You make my heart sing.</p></li>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] sequence of leaf blocks
[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
Track one: <blockquote><h2>Wild thing</h2>
<p>You make <em>my heart</em> sing.</p><p>You make
everything.</p> <p>Wile thing.</p></blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
Track one:
<blockquote>
  <h2>Wild thing</h2>
  <p>You make <em>my heart</em> sing.</p>
  <p>You make everything.</p>
  <p>Wile thing.</p>
</blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT: CONSERVATIVE] but lack of whitespace must be preserved

Any lack of space between parent and child tags or sibling tags forces them on same line.
This rule is applied independently at each block boundary

``````````````````````````````````````````````````
Track one:
<blockquote><h2>Wild thing</h2>
  <p>You make <em>my heart</em> sing.</p><p>You make everything.</p>
  <p>Wile thing.</p></blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] mixed leaf and anonymous inline blocks

The content of the block quote is the same as for the
*leaf block/mixed leaf and anonymous inline block sequences*
case:

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
Lyrics: <blockquote><h2>Wild thing</h2>You 
make <p>my heart
sing.</p> You make <i>everything.</i><hr> Wild
thing,<p>I think <em>I love you</em> But

  wanna know for sure
</blockquote>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT: CONSERVATIVE]

> ### ðŸŒ¶ For CONSERVATIVE mode, we might implement length-based line wrapping
> of the block contents for cases where the lack of whitespace between
> child blocks results in excessively long lines.
> Work breaks within child element content provide ample semantics-preserving
> line wrap opportunities.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````
Lyrics:
<blockquote><h2>Wild thing</h2>You make

``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] mixed leaf and anonymous inline blocks with extraneous whitespace

Same as prior case input, but with extraneous whitespace added both
between and withing child blocks.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

## unknown elements


### [CASE] unknown tags in simple text

By default, CSS treats unknown tags as inline.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
a

makes my
<song beat="joyful">heart</song>.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
a <wild>thing</wild> makes my <song beat="joyful">heart</song>.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

### [CASE] unknown tags within a leaf block
[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing.
<person>You</person> make
my <organ>heart</organ> sing.</p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<p>Wild thing. <person>You</person> make my <organ>heart</organ> sing.</p>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

### [CASE] unknown tags within a container block
[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

## unclosed elements

Inlines are never implicitly closed, even when the parent
leaf or container block in which it opened closes. This
mimics browser behavior.

[//]: # (todo: apparently, htmlparser2 doesn't agree with Safari.
          The case below reflect htmlparser2's behavior, not 
          Safari's. Not sure how Firefox or Chrome handle this,
          THOUGH I SHOULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SPEC SAYS.
          Then do one of the following:
           - log a bug with htmlparser2
           - code some workarounds to htmlparser2's non-spec behavior.
           - accept that Safari doesn't follow spec.)

### unclosed inlines

#### [CASE] with no trailing whitespace
inline tag forced close by outer inline

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<i>Italic. <u>Underlined.</i> Now what?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<i>Italic. <u>Underlined.</i> Now what?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT: EXPLICIT_CLOSE]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<i>Italic. <u>Underlined.</u></i> Now what?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] with trailing whitespace

So where should an inserted closing tag go relative to the
whitespace? Before or after? If the source explicitly closed
the element, it would of course make that decision.

`htmlnorm` will make insert the tag so that the contents
are wrapped *tightly*, as that is by far the most likely
intent.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<i>Italic. <u>Underlined.
</i> Now what?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

[OUT: EXPLICIT_CLOSE]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<i>Italic. <u>Underlined.</u> </i> Now what?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] intersecting block boundaries

Nested inline forced closed by parent container (see question
above about whether this is correct). Outer inline
remains open across both the open and close of the 
container.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

  </u>
</blockquote>
Now what?<br>
</i>
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] unclosed cascade

Notice how in the rendered form of the unaltered IN value,
the browser will include a tailing space after "Quote."
within the resulting quotation marks. This is another 
confirmation of how leading and trailing whitespace within
and between inline elements can be significant.

[//]: # (todo consider using this example in the `browser-whitespace-study`,
          and linking to it here.)

[//]: # (todo![now] based on the browser rendering of the implied closings,
          the explicit closing logic of htmlnorm is INCORRECT!  I need to 
          confirm this by installing Firefox and see how it renders all of these.
          .
          THE ACTUAL logic appears to be to insert then implied tag exactly where
          it is triggered, where htmlnorm generates and event for it, and all my
          logic to "don't pop traiing whitespace" is wrong.
          .
          ANOTHER THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING: the browser only put the 
          implied close of the Q tag inside the parent blockquote, not the B
          or S elements, even though all start within the blockquote, even 
          though one starts before and one after the Q element. So:
          - WRT Q, htmlparser2 is correct.
          - WRT to B and S, and probably I and U, htmlparser2 is incorrect.
          - If htmlparser2 does not fix this, I may have to hack it myself,
            making a list of the two classes of inlines and how they auto-close,
            much like htmlparser2 already does for blocks.)

``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] unclosed interleaved

[//]: # (todo: here, htmlparser2 forces q, b, blockquote and u to 
          close between "Quote." and the explicit `</i>`, since they all 
          opened within the i element. This runs counter to the browser
          rendering immensely: the b, blockquote and u are not auto-closed,
          only the q is.
          .
          Possible rules:
          - "formatting" inlines like i, b, s, u and u, are never implicitly closed.
          - "container" inlines are implicitly closed, by both parent inlines or
            containers.
          - HTML5 elements are closed according to HTML5 rules, otherwise they are
            closed by the next rule...
          - block elements are only closed by parent containers [need to check])

#### [CASE] interleaved OLD

Inlines are not even implicitly closed when interleaved. In effect,
they open and close independently. This mimics browser behavior.

## beyond redemption

While browsers are able to handle all sorts of "tag soup", `htmlnorm` will
make no attempt to normalize malformed HTML beyond some very limited cases,
e.g. unclosed elements, as covered above.

Why? `htmlnorm`'s primary purpose is to facilitate testing where semantic 
equivalence is the only thing that matters. For well-formed HTML, `htmlnorm` can
normalize the HTML so that the only differences between the tested function's
actual result and the expected result will be semantic.

`htmlnorm` can normalize some not-so-well-formed HTML, in particular unclosed
tags. This is entirely optional, and whether tests use that option depends on
whether the tests care about whether tags are specifically closed or unclosed,
even if the semantics don't.

But for other kinds of malformation, the semantics become ambiguous. The safest
thing to do for the reliability of tests is to compare the outputs and expected
outputs as-is. Doing otherwise may hide what should be considered failures,
either in the function being tested or the test code and data itself. Perhaps
the malformed HTML output is intentional. The test will want to make assertions
on that exact value.

## content modifications

### attribute exclusion

#### [CASE] excludes attributes in targeted element
The test configuration of htmlnorm excludes `exclude` and `itemscope` attributes
on `input` elements.

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<input type="checkbox" exclude="x" id="cats" class="setting" checked itemscope> Cats?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<input checked class="setting" id="cats" type="checkbox"> Cats?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### [CASE] does not change other elements

[IN]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<area type="checkbox" exclude="x" id="cats" class="setting" checked itemscope> Cats?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
[OUT]
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
<area checked class="setting" exclude="x" id="cats" itemscope type="checkbox"> Cats?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
